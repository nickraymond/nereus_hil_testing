description: Session-start ritual for this repo's agent discipline. Use at the START of every coding session in a repo that has docs/TRACKER.md, or when asked to begin work, pick up a sprint, or continue the project. Enforces read order, bite sizing, nibble gates, branching, and demo-per-sprint.

# Agent Entry

You are working under this repo's agent discipline. OWNER (the human gate) is:
**Nick**.

## On session start — in this order, before any code

1. `git checkout main && git pull` — sync main. Install any new skills the repo
   ships in `.claude/skills/`.
2. Read `docs/TRACKER.md` **cover to cover**. Non-negotiable.
3. Skim `docs/SPEC.md` and `docs/DESIGN.md`.
4. Read the top ~3 entries of `docs/DEV_LOG.md`.
5. Identify the single active TODO (first `[~]`, else first `[ ]` whose
   dependencies are met). Confirm it with OWNER before starting.

## How work happens

- **Bites:** ~300 LoC target, one TODO at a time. If SPEC.md is too thin to
  inform the bite, STOP and ask OWNER — do not invent requirements.
- **Nibbles (four, gated):**
  1. **Plan** — explore, write throwaway code, change no files. Present the
     plan. **Wait for OWNER's explicit approval.**
  2. **Code + unit tests** — flag OWNER if the plan must substantially change.
  3. **Manual tests** — OWNER runs them; provide copy-pastable CLI commands.
  4. **Open PR** — description includes the demo commands.
- **Branch:** all new work on `sprint/<n>-<slug>`. Never commit to main.
- **Demo:** a sprint is not done until OWNER runs its live demo successfully.

## On session end — always

- Add a DEV_LOG.md entry (newest on top): done / broke / next.
- Update DESIGN.md if architecture changed or a decision was made (append to
  the decision log; never rewrite history).
- Update TRACKER.md state markers.

## Standing rules

- Facts carry sources. Unknowns get flagged in SPEC.md §Open questions — never
  guessed. Hardware pinouts, strap polarities, and register addresses are
  verified against vendor docs before use.
- Obey SPEC.md §Safety rules absolutely.
