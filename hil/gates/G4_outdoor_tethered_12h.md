# G4 — outdoor tethered 12 h (Release R1)

When: Tue 10/6 (PDT), 12 h of capture + a 3 h completion tail. Owner: Test Engineer + Nick (puts
the box outside). Units: bmcam003 (SPOT-33507C), bmcam004 (SPOT-31593C), both on **RC1** (the
development tip frozen Mon 10/5 EOD). Mains power, nereus000 on both USB consoles.
Plan: RELEASE_PLAN §2 (G4), D1, D3, D4, D5. Evidence: `runs/g4_outdoor12h_<YYYYMMDD>/`.

## Pass (RELEASE_PLAN)

D1, D3, D4 hold for 12 h; no bus drops.

## Criteria

| id | criterion | PASS when | evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| G4.1 | production config (D5) | both bridges read back `bridgePowerControllerEnabled 1`, `sampleIntervalMs 3600000`, `sampleDurationMs 600000`; heal cap 24/day per Spotter in the backend settings; units per_boot, cron armed, real halt; runtime sha == RC1 on both | `snapshots/*_g4_start_*`, `console/bridge_readback.txt`, `api/gateway_settings.json` |
| G4.2 | every wake happened (no bus drops) | each unit: one bus-on window per hour, 12/12 (console `power on for` / bus lines), and a `<WS>` or START per window; 0 unscheduled bus-off events | `analysis/windows.csv` |
| G4.3 | D1 complete within 3 h | 100 % of media captured in the 12 h are complete at the backend ≤ 3 h after capture (`captured_at` → complete time) | `analysis/media.csv` |
| G4.4 | D1 0 redundant heals | 0 heal commands asking for chunks the backend already held at send time | `analysis/heals.csv` |
| G4.5 | heal cap respected | heal commands per Spotter ≤ the cap in any 24 h window | `analysis/heals.csv` |
| G4.6 | D3 on-demand capture | ≥ 3 `trg` per unit (console lane, inside a bus window), each → one media row, complete ≤ 3 h | `steps.log`, `analysis/media.csv` |
| G4.7 | D4 visible | every trg, ack and heal in G4.4–G4.6 is on logs.html (full list, not a sample) | `analysis/logs_check.csv` |
| G4.8 | 0 SSH needed | no write over ssh to a unit during the 12 h + tail | `gate.log` |
| G4.9 | thermal / power sanity | no Pi undervoltage / thermal throttle in the cycle logs; Spotter `post` clean at start and end (spotter-health-check skill) | `console/post_*.txt` |

## Preconditions

- [ ] G3 PASS; freeze done (RC1 sha recorded; release notes exist).
- [ ] Production switch done at freeze (Mon EOD): bus schedule restored (`runs/s5_console_20260928/restore_schedule.sh`
      pattern: unit HALTED + DISARMED, commit, re-arm in the ~2 min stub window); heal cap 24/day set in the
      per-Spotter settings (backend, S6b backend session's admin API); `BM_HEAL_AUTOSEND` live; bm-heal-driver
      and the conductor STOPPED (backend is the only heal sender).
- [ ] Nick has the box outside, mains connected, console cables to nereus000 checked (`hil_console.sh <SPOT> post`).

## Steps

1. T−30 min: `hil_unit_snapshot.sh` can't be taken on a halted unit: take it inside the first window
   (read-only, < 1 min) or rely on the freeze snapshot + START `cfg=` hash. Read back both bridges'
   bus config over the console. `post` on both Spotters.
2. T0 = the first aligned window (hh:00). Log start in `gate.log`.
3. Every window: no action unless a D3 trigger is scheduled. D3 triggers at T0+2 h, +6 h, +10 h:
   `hil_cmd.sh G4.trg.<n> '{"id":<id>,"c":"trg","v":2}' 8 <SPOT>` right after `[CMD] subscribed`
   (queue only while the bus is OFF is lost: bench-gotchas).
4. Watch (every ~2 h): console queue-full counts, bus windows, backend media completeness. No
   intervention unless a unit stops waking for 2 windows (then: BLOCKED + console `post`, and tell the EM).
5. T0+12 h: stop counting captures. Tail: +3 h for completeness. Then pull the analysis.

## Analysis

- `media.csv`: device, key, captured_at, first chunk at, complete at, chunks, healed (y/n), latency.
- `heals.csv`: command id, sent at, keys/chunks asked, chunks already held at send (redundant if > 0), ack.
- `windows.csv`: Spotter, window start, bus on/off lines, Pi WS/START seen.
Reuse: `tools/bm_bench_conductor.py --report` patterns and the staging admin heal-candidates API
(token on nereus000 only); copy any script used into `hil/tools/` first.

## Restore

The units stay in production config for G5 (no change between G4 and G5 except the power source and
removing nereus000). If G4 FAILs: Wed 10/7 is the slack day: fix, re-run G4 (12 h) only if the fix
touched the units.
